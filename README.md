# Employee Attrition Prediction and Department Classification

## Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition and classify departments based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains information about employees' demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and other relevant factors. The project utilizes a neural network model with shared layers to simultaneously predict attrition and classify departments.

## Contents
1. **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Architecture**: Description of the neural network model architecture, including input layers, shared layers, and output layers for predicting attrition and classifying departments.
3. **Training**: Details on training the model, including hyperparameters, number of epochs, and batch size.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluation of the trained model's performance on the testing data, including accuracy scores for predicting attrition and classifying departments.
5. **Ways to Improve**: Suggestions for improving the model's performance, such as fine-tuning hyperparameters, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, adjusting model architecture, regularization techniques, ensemble methods, cross-validation, data preprocessing, model interpretation, and domain-specific adjustments.
